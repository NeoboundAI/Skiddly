Customer: Oh hi, yes I was looking at that but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. Do you have any discounts available?

Agent: I understand your concern about the price. We do have a special offer for new customers - 20% off your first month. Would that help make the decision easier?

Customer: That sounds good, but I'm really busy right now. Can you call me back later this evening around 7 PM?

Agent: Absolutely! I'll make a note to call you back at 7 PM today. Is this the best number to reach you at?

Customer: Yes, this is fine. Thanks for the discount offer.

Agent: Perfect! I'll call you back at 7 PM with the discount code. Have a great day!

Customer: You too, bye!`,
